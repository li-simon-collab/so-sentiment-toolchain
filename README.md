### Stack Overflow Sentiment Toolchain
This the toolchain for the bachelor's thesis _Sentiment Analysis on Stack
Overflow with Respect to Document Type and Programming Language_. Documentation
will be updated incrementally in the coming week.

### Install
To install the toolchain itself, clone the repository with `git clone
https://github.com/li-simon-collab/so-sentiment-toolchain.git` and `cd` into the
repository directory. For just the toolchain, install the Python packages in the
[`requirements.txt`](requrements.txt) file with `pip install -r
requirements.txt`. To be able to run the tests, you also need to install the
packages in the [`requirements.test.txt`](requirements.test.txt) file.

Additionally, you will need to install Senti4SD separately. You can find
instructions on how to do so [on the Senti4SD GitHub
page](https://github.com/collab-uniba/Senti4SD).

### Runtime requirements
The toolchain depends only on `Python 3.6`, but Senti4SD has additional
requirements.

### Configuration
To be added.
