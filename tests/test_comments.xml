(It's not UB to compile a function that has some paths that return from a `noreturn` function: it's only UB if execution takes those paths at run-time).   Anyway, this is why Keil suggests putting an infloop on paths that would return, because that's easier to debug than returning with corrupt registers.  (Assuming it's like gcc)."
