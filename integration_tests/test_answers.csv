Possible values:             (default): use   for this host and port.      Agent object : explicitly use the passed in Agent.      : causes a new Agent with default values to be used.            [Function] A function that produces a socket/stream to use for the request when the agent option is not used. This can be used to avoid creating a custom Agent class just to override the default createConnection function. See   for more details.       [Integer]: A number specifying the socket timeout in milliseconds. This will set the timeout before the socket is connected.            [Function]            Returns:       As far as your other question: think of a socket as  a  pipe connecting two computers.

 First of all, you should pass the clicked element by passing 'this' as a parameter to the function correctClock       and then you need to add a condition, depending on the id of the element we got. Considering alternative2 is the correct answer...       That's it !  
 Think of a service account as a dummy user.  It has a Google Drive account a google calendar account.  What it doesn't to my knowlage is have a Gmail account.        Normally when you request data using a service account you have to grant the service account access to that data manually.  In the case of google drive you can share a folder with the service account enabling it to access google drive.  (you can also upload to its drive account but that's out of scope for this question)    There is no way to grant another user access to your Gmail account so there is no way to use a service account with a normal user Gmail account.      Note: If this is Not a normal user Gmail account and is in fact one based on google domains then you can grant the service account access to all the emails of the other users on the domain via the admin section.     Other wise you need to look into using Oauth2 to access gmail.  
 You really cannot do this using   but you can with a little regex:       Here is an  EXAMPLE     If you need the period at the end of the sentence, modify the regex slightly to remove the period from the character match at the end of the phrase,   instead of       
 I think this is be caused due to weak references and the fact that you don't have anything holding onto the delegate object, so it is deallocated as soon as that function leaves scope. Internally, an object should always have a weak reference to it's delegate to avoid retain cycles, but if you want an object other than   to be the delegate you need something with a strong reference.    I believe this could be solved by creating a delegate property in your view controller so that there's a strong reference to that object...       
 The parameter you pass to   must be a function, meaning your   needs to return a function. This is often called currying, partial application, or a closure.                    In ES6 it's much easier to write with arrow functions.     
 As  @v.ladynev  briefly explained, your issue was that you wanted to initialize a lazy relation outside of the persistence context.    I wrote an article about this, you might find it helpful:      
 If you have this issue than normally it already helps if you click Build -> Clean Project and then Build -> Rebuild Project.    After that it should work. If during that process an error message pops up then that is the reason why the preview doesn't work.  
 I take it that it's your   that's stopping the proper click function so just reinstate it when you're on mobile.    Get the width of the window, then within your function add an if statement to check if the window width is bigger than mobile, if it is then run this function. If you're on mobile, it'll get skipped.     
 It looks like your script is finishing before the page makes the second request. If that's the case, then you need to use  , combined with an  :       You'll need to use a supported expected condition, which can be found  here .    EDIT: Upon investigation of this particular JSON endpoint, it seems that a cookie is set upon the first load the endpoint, and any subsequent requests containing the cookie in the header will return the JSON. This means that you have to make sure your webdriver is handling cookies correctly, and load the page twice. Optionally, you can spoof the cookie if it's deterministic.

 The only problem I can see in your code is in your delegate:       You set the delegate to fill the parent. What will happen here?    Well, the   extends the  , so it has a   that holds all the instances of your delegates next to each other. The size of that   is determined by the size of all visible instances of your delegate in relation to the count of your model. How exactly it is calculated is still unknown to me. ( see here  )     However, with your   you resize the delegate to always fill the  . This will lead to a growth of the  , which will lead to a growth of the   and so on. You have a binding loop.    Intrestingly, when you use the   instead of a number as model, QML seems to detect this problem, and does not accept the  . Therefore in your example, the   of each   is  0 . This leads to your problem, that you have the texts of both pages on top of each other.     Lessons learned:   never use   in the root node of a delegate.      
 So you're generating a list of 100,000 numbers, and then putting that back into another query?    If you're getting the numbers from a table, take the query that generated the list of numbers in the first place, put it inside the in() brackets, and you'll see a large improvement immediately.    Restructure them both to use a JOIN, instead of in() and you'll see even more.    OR, depending on your DB structure, just do      
 Because of the padding on the logo, it will cause the logo to actually have a max-width of 530px. To prevent this, you can use box-sizing to tell the browser to include the padding in the width with    :       Or a     equation to remove the padding from the width.       Either piece of code will solve your problem.    Note: I normally use this code in all of my responsive sites.     
 I'll paste a summary of their approaches  I wrote in a Reddit comment :       Redux is heavily influenced by Functional Programming principles:      It encourages use of "pure" functions, wants you to handle your data "immutably" (ie, make copies and modify the copies, don't directly update the original values), and focuses on explicit definitions of data flow and update logic.   It gives you features like the ability to do "time-travel debugging" (stepping back and forth between individual updates to your state, or loading in a copy of the app state from a customer crash report to see what was going on).   Idiomatic Redux code "normalizes" nested or relational objects, like a database. Each item is defined in one place, and other parts of your data would refer to that item by ID only, leaving lookups for later   The usual complaint is that there's too much boilerplate code, and that typical Redux usages involves things like string constants and switch statements.   Use it when you want to explicitly track the flow of data through your application, or want to see exactly why your application wound up in a certain state.       MobX is influenced by Object-Oriented Programming and Reactive Programming principles:      It lets you define specific pieces of data as being "observable", then wraps those up and tracks any changes made to that data and automatically updates any other piece of code that is observing the data.   It encourages use of standard mutating code, like someObject.someField = someValue, and someArray.push(someValue), with the real update logic being hidden internal to MobX.   Idiomatic MobX code keeps your data in nested form and maintain direct references from one object to another   One possible complaint would be that you don't see as much of when and how your data is being updated, and it may be harder to track through the application   Use it when you prefer an OOP style over Functional, prefer your data to be represented and manipulated by classes instead of plain functions, or want to write less explicit update logic and let the library do the work of managing things.         For more in-depth comparisons, I can highly recommend Preethi Kasireddy's talk  MobX vs Redux: Comparing the Opposing Paradigms  from ReactConf 2017, and Robin Wieruch's article  Redux or MobX: An attempt to dissolve the confusion  .  I also have a  number of other comparisons collected in my React/Redux links list .  
 EDIT: We've transitioned our API from .../notes/... to .../onenote/... in graph. This transition is complete.       The reason you are seeing this now is that we are making a change in the graph api URLs for onenote - they will change from graph.microsoft.com/.../notes/... to graph.microsoft.com/.../onenote/..., as you noticed in the URLs above.    Therefore, sometime soon, you will need to update your application code to target that URL. Due to the nature of our beta API in graph.microsoft.com, it is still undergoing some changes - once we go to v1.0, you should not expect any of those breaking changes. If you're looking for a stable alternative in the meantime, our API in    ... is an API with the same functionality as the one you're using in graph that you can expect not to change.    That said, the inconsistency in returned URLs that you point out above is a bug that we have fixed now, even though the change to /onenote from /notes will happen soon.  
 Here - I think this works. I made several changes, but note I built the queries as strings and used sp_executesql to run them. A benefit of that is that you can print the output and execute it in another window to make sure it works.    There are a few print statements - I used them to check each piece as I progressed through your script. I left them in so you can kind of see the thought process of checking one piece at a time.      
 You will need to add something like the     to your servlet container.    I'm adding the details for the configuration from the link mentioned above just in case the content of the link goes away:    You will need to edit web.xml to add a filter and a filter mapping:       If you need a more portable approach for use in different application servers, you might end up writing a generic servlet     like I did.    After all that is no big deal as you just have set the   and   headers for     on your given paths.    As a starter, I stumpled upon  this  implementation and  how  Tomcat does it.

 You can do this using  supervisord . Your main process should be bound to supervisord in docker image and two java processes should be managed using supervisord.         supervisord‘s primary purpose is to create and manage processes based   on data in its configuration file. It does this by creating   subprocesses. Each subprocess spawned by supervisor is managed for the   entirety of its lifetime by supervisord (supervisord is the parent   process of each process it creates). When a child dies, supervisor is   notified of its death via the SIGCHLD signal, and it performs the   appropriate operation.      Following is a sample supervisord config file which start two java processes. (supervisord.conf)       In your docker file you should, do something like this:

 It's a little difficult to answer this question because I fear you have a lot of misunderstandings about how Swift memory management works and how iOS view controller life cycles work. They're not surprising misunderstandings; it's just hard to know where to start here. I may cover things you're already aware of.    First, start with studying the  Automatic Reference Counting  section of the Swift manual. The key to understanding ARC is that it is based on strong references. If two things have strong references to each other, that's a retain loop and until it's broken, neither object will be deallocated.    It isn't really meaningful to ask "is Swift by default autorelease." Autorelease is a slightly more advanced concept that you probably don't have to understand for basic Swift. (I've worked with it so long that I hope I'm not being overly dismissive of whether people need to understand it, but I think you can avoid thinking about it for now.) Autorelease has to do with objects that you want to exist for the rest of the current event loop, but would otherwise have a zero retain count. While it still exists in ARC, it's mostly for manual retain counting, and you rarely need to think too much about it in Swift, particularly as a beginner.        I also noticed that viewDidLoad() was called before init(), since I had breakpoints in both functions.      It's not possible for   to be called before   on a given object. Your problem, almost certainly, is that there are more than one of this object, and that's surprising you. Generally if you   (or   in the debugger) it will show you the address of the object. If it has a different address, it's a different object. You may want to implement   so you can put a breakpoint there as well and explore the life cycle of the view controller.    I assume somewhere there's an   call on this button. What's almost certainly happening is that you're calling   multiple times (perhaps because you are confused about view lifecycle), and each call adds the button to the view. So you get more and more buttons in the view, and each takes memory. You need to make sure you only add things once if you only want one. You can see this problem with   in the debugger (or  ). You'll probably see a ton of buttons. This isn't a leak. These are just objects you're creating that you didn't mean to create.  
   If files are not present update some flags like IsFile1Found to false and pass these flags to stored procedure which truncates on conditional basis.   If file is empty then Using powershell through Execute Process Task you can extract first two rows if there are two rows (header + data row) then it means data file is not empty. Then you can truncate the table and import the data. other approach could be  you can load data into some staging table and from these staging table insert data to the destination table using SQL stored procedure and truncate these staging tables after data is moved to all the destination table. In this way before truncating destination table you can check if staging tables are empty or not.

 Well, I don't know Qt, but I know Cocoa quite well. Speaking in terms of the Objective-C API, your   call is probably doing the equivalent of  . Unfortunately,   doesn't work properly for minimized windows. It leaves a "ghost" window in the Dock, which can be unminimized to an actual ghost window. That is, it's just an image of the window, it's not the actual live window.    It does work to call  . I don't know what the Qt equivalent would be. You have to be careful to avoid some of the secondary consequences that   has beyond those of  , though. For example, some windows are set to release themselves on close, which you'd want to disable. Also, the window delegate's   method will be called and it should do nothing for a not-really-closing call.    Don't worry that "closing" is more severe or permanent than "hiding" or "ordering out". It's really much the same thing, other than the above-mentioned additional consequences. For example, it is still possible to re-show a window that's been closed, etc.    The question is, does Qt give you the flexibility to do it. Alternatively, this can be considered a bug in Qt, that its   implementation uses   rather than   on minimized windows.    Finally, I'll ask if you really want to implement this feature. It's going to confuse users. When you minimize a window, it animates the minimization to the Dock. That gives the user a strong impression of where to find the window. If the window is not subsequently found where it went, the user is not going to know to look elsewhere. Likewise, Exposé/Mission Control shows users the minimized windows of an app in addition to the normal windows. Your supposedly minimized-to-tray windows won't show up there because they're no longer really minimized.    Perhaps just disable minimization. Have the user simply close the window when they're done with it and re-open it from your status item menu.

 There's nothing magic about using  . You can interpolate unsafe variables into a string and then prepare that string. Boom—SQL injection. Preparing a statement doesn't make it safe.       What makes it safe is using parameters.       Naturally, people say "use prepared statements" because you must use prepared statements to use parameters. But just saying "use prepared statements" kind of misses the point, and some developers get the wrong understanding.    The PDO quote() method is also safe, but I find it simpler and easier to use parameters.     
 To sort out the numbers which are too long, you can use a negative lookbehind and lookahead that doesn't match preceding and successing digits:               To match only numbers with the key in column 2 is rather hard. Maybe you match either the key or the numbers and do the logic afterwards:

 There is  no  guarantee that join terms,   clauses etc will be executed in any given order. If your query relies on that, it's buggy.    In this case the correct solution would be  a   expression , which (mostly) forces ordering.       Note that no   clause is necessary here, since   produces   if no clauses match, and   is false for a   clause.    This may also screw up index selection, but so will most other approaches like a subquery with   or (ab)using a CTE.    I'd argue that it's a misfeature for   to   on inverted ranges, rather than doing something like flipping them or evaluating to null, precisely because it makes such queries hard to write.

 You have to bind a   event handler for every image.    Also, don't forget to use   keyword in order to declares a block scope local variable.

 What you are currently doing is querying for smallest age value from your dataset.

 Based on what I can see in the code you have posted the changes should be permanent.  One thing I would like to point out is that your code that is creating the INSERT statement is vulnerable to SQL Injection Attack.  You can research what this is and find out if it applies to you (basically it all depends on if Access supports SQL commands like DROP TABLE and so on.    A number of things I would check.       Find the MDB file in your solution and check its properties.  One of the properties will be "Copy To Output Directory" and this needs to be set to Copy If Newer rather than Copy Always.  When you set the value to Copy Always then each time you run the program the empty copy of your MDB file is overwriting the MDB that has data in it in your DEBUG/RELEASE folder.  The Copy if Newer will only replace the data file if you make changes to the structure of the MDB thus making its date newer than the one in your debug folder.     If the above is not the issue, then you might have a corrupt MDB and you need to open it in Access and run a repair on it.

 There is a ticket at Restlet to support this, however they have not implemented this:        There is also a Camel ticket:        As it seems Restlet takes  forever  to fix this on their side, we may have to bit the bullet and make a special fix in the camel-restlet component  
 The XML document changes the default namespace when it gets to the Product element, so at this point you need to start using the prod namespace and not the prodfeed one.    You can also simplify the query, by moving the opening '[' back to before productId, which means you don't have to do the parent::* bit.     
 After trying for a while to do this the "right" way, in the end the path of least resistance was using a shell script:     
 From  Account management         Write operations in the Management API (e.g. create, update, delete,   patch) for Web Property, View (Profile), and Goal resources are   currently available as a developer preview in limited beta. If you're   interested in using these features, request access to the beta.      Unless i am mistaken you have not applied for access to the beta program.  Note it can take up to a month to get access you will hear from Google if you have been granted access.    Assuming that you have applied for beta.    There appears to be a bug in this currently the bug log can be found  here .   Google has been notified we will have to wait for them to fix it.  
 Thanks to @Vojtech, I got the answer       The only problem right now is nothing is animating. I'll edit the answer when few screens animate &amp; tabs don't  
 You could go the way from the other side. Just add the   objects to your one   object's collection. After that save the   object to database and it should work like you want.    Only as sample code:       And of course, instead of just create a new one you should check if the directory already exist in datacontext and use that one.  
 If you can call many tuples of values in parallel instead of sequentially...       Comparing with the other solutions that must be run rowwise...        How it works     For each tuple in  , we look up rows that match   and   exactly and then "roll" to the nearest value of   -- this doesn't quite match the OP's rule (of looking within a bound of nC*[0.9, 1.1]), but that rule could easily be applied after-the-fact. For each match, we take the tuple's "group number,"  , the row numbers that were matched, and the values of   on those rows.    Then we join on group number and  , matching exactly on the former and rolling to nearest on the latter. If there are multiple nearest matches, we take the first with  .    We can then take the row number of each tuple's match and look it up in the original table.     Performance     So the vectorized solution seems to have a big performance benefit, as usual with R.     If you can only pass ~5 tuples at a time (as for the OP) instead of 200, there will still probably be benefits from this approach vs   and similar, thanks to binary search, as @F.Privé suggested in a comment.    As noted in @HarlanNelson's answer, adding indices to the table might further improve performance. See his answer and  .     Fix for numC rolling to one value     Thanks to the OP for identifying this problem:       Here, we see one row, but we should be seeing five. One fix (though I'm not sure why) is converting to integers:     
 Java 9 introduced creating small unmodifiable Collection instances using a concise one line code, for maps the signature of factory method is:       This method is overloaded to have 0 to 10 key-value pairs, e.g.       Similarly you can have up to ten entries.    For a case where we have more than 10 key-value pairs, there is a different method:       Here is the usage.       You can visit  Java 9 Collection Changes Overview  to read more.    Cheers !  
 That blog posting is a bit out of date.  The actually implemented scheme in Java 9 is documented in  JEP 223: New Version-String Scheme      The meaning of the first three numbers is standardized.  The meaning of the 4th and (any) subsequent numbers are left to the vendor to specify.    Note also the interesting relationship between the 2nd and 3rd numbers.    Here are the relevant parts of the JEP.        "The sequence may be of arbitrary length but the first three elements are assigned specific meanings, as follows:             - The major version number, incremented for a major release that contains significant new features as specified in a new edition of the Java SE Platform Specification, e.g., JSR 337 for Java SE 8. Features may be removed in a major release, given advance notice at least one major release ahead of time, and incompatible changes may be made when justified. The   version number of JDK 8 is 8; the   version number of JDK 9 is 9. When   is incremented, all subsequent elements are removed.          - The minor version number, incremented for a minor update release that may contain compatible bug fixes, revisions to standard APIs mandated by a Maintenance Release of the relevant Platform Specification, and implementation features outside the scope of that Specification such as new JDK-specific APIs, additional service providers, new garbage collectors, and ports to new hardware architectures.          - The security level, incremented for a security-update release that contains critical fixes including those necessary to improve security.   is not reset to zero when   is incremented. A higher value of   for a given   value, therefore, always indicates a more secure release, regardless of the value of  .         The fourth and later elements of a version number are free for use by downstream consumers of the JDK code base. Such a consumer may, e.g., use the fourth element to identify patch releases which contain a small number of critical non-security fixes in addition to the security fixes in the corresponding security release.     
 If you can spare two cells somewhere, you can avoid both looping and error handling, say we use  B1  and  B2 .  In  B1  place the proposed worksheet name and fill  B2  using:       Then check the Boolean result in  B2 :         
 You can save the 'last fetch date' and then, use  /search  to filter by date adding   as a filter in your request. You hace a lot of filters in the search like the channelId, channel type, etc.  
 Try the below code, it uses simpler xpath expression.  If you click on the cell, then you must wait until the checkbox appears on the page and be clikable, it does not happen immediately, the first click fires some javascript which makes the checkbox visible and clickable, it must take some time, usually several dozen milliseconds, but if either a network connection or server or computer or all of them are slow, then sometimes it may take a few seconds or even over a dozen of seconds.:     
  
 Based on your clarification: Your problem is overwriting the instance of le in your loop, so that it is only trained on the last column. Based on your code I would suggest putting them in a dict, e.g. as follows:       But as commented above, also look at  this.   
 You are initializing   to the value  .  The only time   can possibly change is in the first loop, where it is promptly followed by a   statement, exiting your method.  The only way your if statement can be reached is if you didn't return during the first loop, so if it reaches that if statement, then   must be unchanged since its initial assignment of  .    Some unrelated advice: You should use the   operator when comparing strings.  For example,  .  Otherwise, you're comparing the memory address of the two String objects rather than their values.    You may need to share your   method to ensure all bugs are addressed, though.  
 Try   in association. Something like below:         Refer  this . The   is introduced in Rails 5.     EDIT        I see the two method names are same, i.e., after comment creation, the   is called which again calls the  . Can you try changing the name of the method maybe?     ANOTHER SUGESSTION     Can you change the method to        or        Do you still get the same error?  
 Use     to access the values corresponding to a key and then use     to get the   value.                  
 If you have latitude and longitude in your data, seems like it would be something like:
